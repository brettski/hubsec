This repository will show if a secret is read from a Forked PR

Some update.

Is the environment variable going to write from a fork pr?

Secret redacted. Trying a json object.

Adding this line to produce a pull request. 

## PR's

PR's, when submitted do fire-off the CI, though no secrets are read. This is expected process. The question I have is what is the correct process to test that PR, i.e. run in through the CI as me. Of course after vetting the code. 

This doesn't seem correct. Even though this user is a collaborator on the repo, they still don't have access to the secrets. I like it, it just isn't what I expected.
